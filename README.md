# Car-Price-Prediction-Model

This code includes the implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network that predicts car prices based on various features such as engine size, car weight, and fuel type. The dataset used in this model is the Car Price dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction).
The goal of this project is to develop a regression model that establishes a relationship between input features related to cars and their corresponding prices.


# Libraries Used
This code uses the following Python libraries:

pandas - numpy - matplotlib - seaborn - scikit-learn - tensorflow - keras

# Model Architecture
The implemented model is an MLP neural network. It consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer is composed of multiple neurons (nodes) that perform computations and pass the information forward through the network.
